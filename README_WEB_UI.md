# qPKI Web User Interface

## Overview

The qPKI Web UI provides a comprehensive Flask-based interface for managing hybrid post-quantum certificates. The system supports both RSA and ECC classical algorithms combined with Dilithium post-quantum signatures, ensuring certificates remain secure against both classical and quantum computer attacks.

## Features

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Starting the Web Application

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:9090`

### Directory Structure

The web application automatically creates:
- `./ca/` - Certificate Authority storage
- `./certificates/` - Certificate storage

## Usage Guide

### 1. Create Your First Certificate Authority

1. Navigate to **Certificate Authorities > Create CA**
2. Fill in the CA information:
   - **Common Name:** Your CA name (e.g., "MyCompany Root CA")
   - **Organization:** Your organization name
   - **Country:** Two-letter country code
3. Select cryptographic parameters:
   - **Classical Algorithm:** Choose RSA or ECC
   - **RSA Key Size:** 2048, 3072, or 4096 bits (if RSA selected)
   - **ECC Curve:** P-256, P-384, or P-521 (if ECC selected)
   - **Dilithium Variant:** 2, 3, or 5 (higher = more secure)
   - **Validity Period:** 5-20 years
4. Click **Create Certificate Authority**

### 2. View Certificate Authorities

1. Navigate to **Certificate Authorities > List CAs**
2. View all created CAs with:
   - Common name and organization
   - Cryptographic algorithm type
   - Creation and expiration dates
   - Actions (view details, download)

### 3. Certificate Creation

1. Navigate to **Certificates > Create Certificate**
2. Select the issuing CA from the dropdown
3. Fill in the certificate information:
   - **Common Name:** The certificate subject (e.g., "www.example.com")
   - **Organization:** Subject organization
   - **Email:** **Required** - Contact email for expiration notifications
   - **Certificate Type:** Root CA, Subordinate CA, or End-entity certificate
4. The cryptographic parameters are inherited from the selected CA
5. Set the validity period (1-10 years)
6. Click **Create Certificate**

### 4. Certificate Management

- **View Certificates:** Navigate to **Certificates > List Certificates**
- **Certificate Details:** Click on any certificate to view full details
- **Certificate Status:** Certificates show their status (Valid, Expired, Revoked)
- **Expiration Monitoring:** Days until expiration with color-coded urgency
- **Certificate Revocation:** Revoke certificates with reason codes

### 5. Email Notifications

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the main menu
2. Configure SMTP settings for your email provider
3. Set up notification intervals and customize email templates
4. Test email functionality
5. Enable automatic monitoring or run manual checks

### 6. Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL)

- **Revoke Certificates:** Use the revoke button in certificate details
- **View CRLs:** Navigate to CRL section for each CA
- **Download CRLs:** Export CRL files for external use

## Technical Details

### Certificate Format

qPKI stores certificates in JSON format containing:

```json
{
  "certificate": {
    "version": "v3",
    "serial_number": "...",
    "signature_algorithm": "hybrid",
    "issuer": { "common_name": "...", "organization": "..." },
    "subject": { "common_name": "...", "organization": "..." },
    "validity": {
      "not_before": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "not_after": "2034-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    },
    "cryptographic_info": {
      "hybrid_key_info": {
        "type": "Hybrid (RSA + Post-Quantum)",
        "classical_algorithm": { ... },
        "post_quantum_algorithm": { ... }
      }
    },
    "public_keys": { ... },
    "signature": {
      "classical_signature": "...",
      "dilithium_signature": "...",
      "classical_algorithm": "RSA"
    },
    "fingerprint": "..."
  },
  "private_keys": { ... }
}
```

### Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** In the current implementation, private keys are stored alongside certificates for demonstration purposes. In a production environment:

- Private keys should be stored securely (HSM, encrypted storage)
- Access controls should be implemented
- Key backup and recovery procedures should be established
- Certificate revocation lists should be maintained

### API Endpoints

The web application provides REST API endpoints:

- `GET /api/algorithms` - Available cryptographic algorithms
- `GET /api/verify/<cert_type>/<filename>` - Certificate validation
