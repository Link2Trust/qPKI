## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

The qPKI system is a revolutionary hybrid Public Key Infrastructure that combines:

- **Classical Cryptography** (RSA/ECC) for current compatibility
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography** (Dilithium) for quantum resistance
- **Dual Signature Approach** providing both current security and future-proofing

## üîç Key Architectural Components

### User Interfaces
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based application with Bootstrap 5 frontend
- **Command Line Interface**: Click-based CLI tool with colored output

### Core Services
- **Hybrid Certificate Authority**: Central PKI management and certificate issuance
- **Key Manager**: Cryptographic key lifecycle management
- **Email Notification Service**: Automated certificate expiration monitoring

### Cryptographic Layer
- **Hybrid Cryptography**: Dual signing with classical and post-quantum algorithms
- **RSA/ECC Support**: Traditional public key cryptography
- **Dilithium Implementation**: NIST post-quantum digital signatures

### Data Storage
- **JSON-based Certificate Storage**: Flexible schema supporting hybrid certificates
- **SQLite Database**: Email notification tracking and history
- **File System Organization**: Structured storage for CAs, certificates, and CRLs

## üöÄ Getting Started with Architecture

1. **Start with the Overview**: Read [architecture_diagram.md](./architecture_diagram.md) for a comprehensive understanding
2. **Visual Learning**: Review the PNG diagrams to visualize system relationships
3. **Deep Dive**: Focus on specific diagrams based on your area of interest:
   - **Developers**: Component Architecture and Key Operational Flows
   - **DevOps/SysAdmins**: Deployment Architecture
   - **Security Teams**: Quantum-Safe Hybrid PKI System Architecture

## üîê Security Architecture Highlights

- **Quantum Resistance**: Future-proof against quantum computer attacks
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintains interoperability with existing PKI systems
- **Hybrid Signatures**: Dual signing provides defense in depth
- **Modular Design**: Easy to update cryptographic algorithms as standards evolve

## üõ†Ô∏è Development and Contribution

When modifying the qPKI system:

1. **Update Architecture Documentation**: Ensure changes are reflected in the architectural diagrams and documentation
2. **Maintain Visual Consistency**: Update relevant PNG diagrams when system components change
3. **Document Dependencies**: Include any new architectural dependencies or relationships
4. **Security Review**: Consider quantum-safe implications of architectural changes
